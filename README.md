📊 Data Analysis & Advanced Pandas Portfolio
Transforming Raw Data into Strategic Business Intelligence
This repository showcases my expertise in the end-to-end data analysis lifecycle, with a heavy emphasis on Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Feature Engineering using Python and Pandas. While many portfolios use "clean" datasets, these projects focus on solving the technical debt and structural inconsistencies found in real-world raw data.

📁 Repository Structure & Project Breakdown
🚗 Car Sales: Advanced Cleaning & Dashboard

Challenge: The uncleaned dataset (car_sales_data_original_uncleaned.xls) contained multi-line strings (e.g., "Acura\nILX") and missing "Year" values.


Solution: Implemented string parsing logic to separate makes/models and used data imputation to restore temporal data for analysis.
