# 📊 Data Analysis & Advanced Pandas Portfolio
**Transforming Raw Data into Strategic Business Intelligence**  

This portfolio demonstrates **end-to-end data analysis expertise**, with a strong focus on **Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Feature Engineering** using Python and Pandas. Unlike typical portfolios using “clean” datasets, these projects tackle **real-world messy data** and extract actionable insights.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

- **Advanced Data Wrangling:**  
  Handle highly unstructured datasets (e.g., multi-line strings, missing time-series data, corrupted columns).

- **Business Intelligence & Metrics:**  
  Generate actionable insights using complex aggregations, multi-level `GroupBy`, and KPI derivation.

- **Feature Engineering:**  
  Create new dimensions for deeper analysis and model readiness.

- **Cross-Domain Expertise:**  
  Experience across **Ecommerce**, **Performance Marketing (Google Ads)**, **Product Sales (Nike)**, and **Academic Performance**.

- ## 🐼 Advanced Pandas Expertise (Hands-On)

This repository strongly demonstrates **real-world Pandas usage**, not tutorial-level examples.

### Pandas Skills Applied

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
  - Handling missing, corrupted, and inconsistent values
  - Converting incorrect data types (strings → numeric, dates → datetime)
  - Removing duplicates and invalid records
  - Standardizing categorical values (brands, products, cities)

- **Feature Engineering**
  - Creating derived columns (e.g., Car Age, Total Sales, Revenue metrics)
  - Preparing datasets for downstream analysis and visualization

- **GroupBy & Aggregations**
  - Single & multi-column `groupby`
  - Aggregations using `sum`, `mean`, `count`, `max`, `min`
  - Business-focused summaries (sales by city, product, customer)

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Trend analysis across time, region, and product
  - Identifying high-performing categories and outliers
  - Supporting insights with visualizations

- **Real-World Data Handling**
  - Working with raw Excel & CSV files
  - Cleaning datasets not designed for analysis
  - Structuring data for dashboards and reporting
